# random_movie

Select a random movie from a directory chosen by the user. Easy and not made well but works for me.

## Installation 

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Leo2660/random_movie
cd random_movie
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 random_movie.py
```



### To-do list

* find movie info on IMDB (score, metascore)
* show output on dialogue window and not on console
